        "1. Easy to Use: Python is comparatively an easier-to-use language as compared to other programming languages.\n",
        "2. Expressive Language: The syntax of Python is closer to how you would write pseudocode. Which makes it capable of expressing the codeâ€™s purpose better than many other languages.\n",
        "3. Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language; this means that the Python installation interprets and executes the code a line at a time.\n",
        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages to be used in Web Development owing to the variety of Web Development platforms built over it like Django, Flask, etc.</br></br>\n",

        "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
        "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
        "* Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
        "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
        "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</br></br>\n",
